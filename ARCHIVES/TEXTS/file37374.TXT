I have seenall the TV episodes at least 3 times and I have seen the movies 10times.  As you can see, I am a seryous.  I can sing the Boomy the Catsong from memory.  My favorite color is blue, but I love Boomy so much Icall it Boomy Blue.I wanted to ask something because I cant bring it up to my family.  IsBoomy real?  I know he is a cartoon, but there has been several times Ithink I have seen him near or aound my house.  Its hard to say cause heruns very fast, but there have been several times when I am pretty sureI aw him.  We have a lot of deers in our backyard and I like to watchthem, but recently it looks like something is chasing them around and Iam pretty sure it is Boomy.  I am really excited to find out."
